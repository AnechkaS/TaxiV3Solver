# Explanations:
# Imports: The script imports the gymnasium library for creating the environment and the random library for selecting random actions.
# Function show_state: This function renders the current state, decodes the observation, and prints the state, step number, and reward.
# Create the environment: The Taxi-v3 environment is created using gym.make("Taxi-v3", render_mode="ansi").
# Reset the environment: The environment is reset to the initial state and the initial observation is displayed using the show_state function.
# Take random actions: The script takes a few random actions, updates the environment, and displays the state and reward after each action. The loop breaks if the episode terminates or is truncated.
